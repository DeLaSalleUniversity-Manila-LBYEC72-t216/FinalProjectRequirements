# Final Project Requirements:

- Apply at least 3 experiments (excluding the introduction),  to a significant problem (utilizing all experiments will get bonus points).
- Difficulty should be higher than our laboratory experiments.
- Documentation: IEEE conference paper format: https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
- Justify the significance, technical difficulty, and social impact of your chosen problem.
- Highlight the specific division of tasks between group members.
- Mind the license of your code and your sources [MAKE SURE TO READ AND FOLLOW LICENSES!!!, YOU SHOULD ALSO CREATE A LICENSE FOR YOUR OWN CODE!]
